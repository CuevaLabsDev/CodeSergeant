## What is Code Sergeant?

Code Sergeant is a macOS menu bar app that monitors your activity during work sessions and gives you real-time feedback when you drift off track. It's like having a (customizable) drill sergeant watching your screen—except this one actually understands context.

Simple website blockers can't tell the difference between "YouTube - Cat Videos" and "YouTube - Python Tutorial." Code Sergeant can. It uses local AI (Ollama) to judge whether what you're doing actually relates to your stated goal, and speaks up when you need a nudge back to work.

### Why I Built This

It started with a post on X about ADHD and body doubling—the idea that having someone physically present helps you focus. I thought, "What if I had an AI body double? One that actually watches what I'm doing and calls me out when I drift?"

I looked into existing solutions: body doubling apps, Zoom coworking sessions. But I didn't want strangers watching me. I like to think out loud, and honestly, they wouldn't even know if I was distracted—I was reading Twitter during Zoom classes all the time and nobody noticed.

So when I couldn't find what I needed, I built it myself.

Code Sergeant is what came out: a privacy-first AI companion that actually understands context. It knows the difference between "YouTube - Python Tutorial" (productive) and "YouTube - Cat Videos" (get back to work). It runs entirely on your machine, so your data stays yours. And it has enough personality to make getting yelled at almost fun.

### Key Features

- **Context-aware judgment** - Knows Stack Overflow is productive when you're coding
- **100% local processing** - Your data never leaves your machine
- **Multiple personalities** - From drill sergeant to supportive buddy
- **Voice interaction** - Say the full wake phrase "Hey Sergeant" to chat hands-free
- **Voice notes** - Say "Take note Sergeant" to capture thoughts without touching the keyboard
- **Native macOS integration** - SwiftUI menu bar app backed by native macOS monitoring APIs

---

## Features

### Activity Monitoring
- **AI-Powered Judgment** - Uses Ollama (local LLM) to understand if your activity matches your goal
- **Smart Fallback** - Rule-based classification when AI is unavailable
- **Native macOS APIs** - Reads window titles directly via AppKit/Quartz, no external dependencies

### Pomodoro Timer
- Built-in timer with configurable work/break durations
- Voice announcements for transitions
- Track completed pomodoros per session

### XP & Rank System
- Earn XP for every completed focus block
- Watch your rank climb as sessions accumulate
- Animated XP display and visual level-up tracking

### Voice Interaction
- **Wake Word** - Say the full phrase "Hey Sergeant" (or your personality's wake word) to interact. "Sergeant" by itself is ignored.
- **Voice Notes** - Say "Take note Sergeant" to capture a hands-free note, automatically transcribed
- **Text-to-Speech** - Hear warnings, encouragement, and session summaries

Outside an active focus session, Code Sergeant only opens the mic after a full wake phrase such as "Hey Sergeant" or the dedicated note phrase "Take note Sergeant". During an active session, it can also speak focus warnings, timer updates, and session summaries.

### Multiple Personalities
Choose your motivation style:
- **Sergeant** - Strict, commanding, no-nonsense
- **Buddy** - Friendly and supportive
- **Advisor** - Professional and thoughtful
- **Coach** - Energetic and motivational

### Privacy First
- All AI processing runs locally (Ollama)
- Session data stays on your machine
- Optional cloud integrations (OpenAI, ElevenLabs) for enhanced features

## Installation

### Option 1: DMG Installer (Recommended)

No Xcode or Python required.

1. Download `CodeSergeant-2.0.0.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/CuevaLabs/CodeSergeant/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag **Code Sergeant** to your **Applications** folder
3. Launch Code Sergeant from Applications or Spotlight
4. Grant **Accessibility** and **Microphone** permissions when prompted

> Both permissions are granted through **System Settings → Privacy & Security**. Accessibility lets the app read window titles; Microphone enables wake word and voice note features.

### Option 2: Build from Source

For developers who want to modify the stack or run without the DMG.

**Requirements**

- macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
- Python 3.10+
- Xcode 15+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (optional but recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CuevaLabs/CodeSergeant.git
cd CodeSergeant

# Create virtual environment and install Python dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Ollama for AI-powered judgment
# Download from https://ollama.ai/, then:
ollama pull llama3.2

# Open the Xcode project
open CodeSergeantUI/CodeSergeantUI.xcodeproj
```

Build and run the `CodeSergeantUI` target in Xcode. The app appears in your menu bar and automatically starts the Python bridge server.

## Quick Start

1. Click the Code Sergeant icon in your menu bar
2. Click **Start Focus Session**
3. Enter your goal (e.g., "Implement the login feature")
4. Work — Code Sergeant monitors your active app and window titles
5. When you drift, it speaks up
